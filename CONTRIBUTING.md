# Contributing

[HSF training][hsf-training] is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons,
fixes to existing material,
bug reports,
and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing,
you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md).
In exchange,
we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can,
and help you become a member of our community.
Everyone involved in [HSF training][hsf-training]
agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue
to tell us about a mistake,
some awkward wording,
or a factual error.
This is a good way to introduce yourself
and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account,
    you can write the convenors an email.
    However,
    we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute,
from writing new exercises and improving existing ones
to updating or filling in the documentation
and submitting [bug reports][issues]
about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.
If you are looking for ideas, please see the 'Issues' tab for
a list of issues associated with this repository,
or you may also look at all issues in [hsf-training][hsf-training-issues]

There is also [a list](hsf-training-gfis) of all issues that are particularly easy and suitable
for first contributions.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome:
we are smarter together than we are on our own.
Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable:
it is easy for people who have been using these lessons for a while
to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be,
so fresh eyes are always welcome.

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
To manage changes, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow].
Each lesson has two maintainers who review issues and pull requests or encourage others to do so.
The maintainers are community volunteers and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson.
To use the web interface for contributing to a lesson:

1. Fork the originating repository to your GitHub profile.
2. Within your version of the forked repository, move to the `gh-pages` branch and
create a new branch for each significant change being made.
3. Navigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the new branches and make revisions as required.
4. Commit all changed files within the appropriate branches.
5. Create individual pull requests from each of your changed branches
to the `gh-pages` branch within the originating repository.
6. If you receive feedback, make changes using your issue-specific branches of the forked
repository and the pull requests will update automatically.
7. Repeat as needed until all feedback has been addressed.

When starting work, please make sure your clone of the originating `gh-pages` branch is up-to-date
before creating your own revision-specific branch(es) from there.
Additionally, please only work from your newly-created branch(es) and *not*
your clone of the originating `gh-pages` branch.
Lastly, published copies of all the lessons are available in the `gh-pages` branch of the originating
repository for reference while revising.
